# API Base URL Configuration
#
# This variable sets the base URL for all API requests to the backend.
#
# Development:
#   - If not set, the app will use window.location.origin (same origin as frontend)
#   - Vite's proxy (configured in vite.config.ts) forwards /api requests to http://localhost:8000
#
# Production:
#   - If not set, the app will use window.location.origin (same origin as frontend)
#   - This works when frontend and backend are served from the same domain
#   - If backend is on a different host/port, set this to the backend URL
#
# Examples:
#   - Same origin: Leave unset or use empty string
#   - Different host: VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com
#   - Different port: VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
#   - With path: VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://example.com/api
#
# VITE_API_BASE_URL=
